Perfect — let’s merge the slide outline with excerpts of your script in speaker notes form. This way you’ve got slide content for the audience and a direct prompt for your delivery.

Slide 1 — Title

AI for Agencies: Save Time, Grow Revenue
Subtitle: “From red alerts to new clients, without burning out.”

Speaker Notes:
“Imagine managing 40, maybe 400 WordPress sites. It’s Monday morning. Two red alerts hit your dashboard and a new client signed last night. How do you keep up? With Airo at GoDaddy, you handle it in minutes.”

Slide 2 — The Frame

Headline: Automate what drains your time. Save your judgment for where it matters most.

Speaker Notes:
“Here’s the frame for today: focus on automating the work that eats up your time, and save your judgment for where it matters most.”

Slide 3 — What You’ll Get

Bullets:

Handle site alerts at scale

Build a client site draft in minutes

Grow with leads, support, and resources

Three rules for using AI in your agency

Speaker Notes:
“The story we’ll walk through together starts off with handling red alerts across your sites. Then, building a first draft site for that new client. Finally, making sure you have the support and leads to keep growing. And as we go, I’ll share three rules you can apply in your agency, with or without our tools.”

Slide 4 — Monday Morning Scenario

Visual Timeline: Alert → Draft → Growth

Speaker Notes:
“Before we dive in, quick show of hands. Who manages more than 10 sites? 50? 100? Awesome, so what I’ll be discussing today should really resonate with a lot of you.”

Slide 5 — Hub Agent (Control Tower)

Bullets:

Centralize signals, act in batches

Automate repetitive tasks

Guardrails for site tools

Reports clients understand

Standardize updates & upgrades

Speaker Notes:
“Let’s start with the red alerts. Think of the Hub Agent as your control tower. I’ll type: ‘Show me all websites under my management.’ Then: ‘Which ones have alerts?’ Right away I know where to act. This is why it helps to centralize signals and act in batches.
Next I’ll enter: ‘Update plugins for all sites with critical updates.’ Hours of work are cut down to minutes. This is the kind of repetitive work AI should own.”

Slide 6 — Demo Flow (Hub Agent)

Visual: Screenshot mockup of Airo chat with sample prompts

Speaker Notes:
“I’ll ask Airo: ‘Run a security scan.’ Then: ‘Show me the overview.’ I see performance, security, and health in one screen. Always translate outputs into plain language your client understands.”

Slide 7 — Site Designer Agent (Content Bottleneck)

Bullets:

Drop in discovery notes → site draft in minutes

Adjust content & style with outcomes

Native Gutenberg blocks, no lock-in

Speaker Notes:
“If getting content from a client is a pain point, you’re not alone. Did you know 83.5% of agencies cite gathering content as their biggest challenge? Site Designer clears this bottleneck. I’ll paste discovery notes from Denver Yoga Collective, and in seconds Airo generates a structured brief and draft site. Our specialized agents do the rest, automating repetitive setup and resolving content bottlenecks.”

Slide 8 — Demo Flow (Site Designer)

Visual: Screenshot mockup of discovery notes pasted into chat

Speaker Notes:
“Now I’ll type: ‘Make the hero headline Find your flow in Denver.’ Then: ‘Add a page for at-home yoga tips.’ And: ‘Apply a calm green palette.’ I’m not clicking through menus. I’m telling Airo the outcome I want. This is where human judgment still matters — AI drafts, humans finish.”

Slide 9 — Partner Agency Program

Bullets:

Leads delivered

Success manager

Priority support

Resources & training

Speaker Notes:
“Tools matter, but growth matters more. That’s why we built the Partner Agency Program. Picture this: it’s your busy season. A lead arrives from GoDaddy’s network. You didn’t chase it, it came to you. Later that week you hit a tough issue. Priority support saves hours. You win the lead. You keep your weekend. And this is how the pieces connect: Hub Agent handles alerts, Site Designer builds the draft, Partner Program helps you grow.”

Slide 10 — Scenario Visual

Visual Timeline: Hub Agent → Site Designer → Partner Program

Speaker Notes:
“This is the end-to-end story: managing red alerts, creating a draft site, and landing the client with support behind you.”

Slide 11 — Misc Agents

Bullets:

Blog creator

Logo generator

Market research

Site Optimizer

Speaker Notes:
“These fill in the gaps between managing sites, building drafts, and scaling your agency. And this is the third rule: when you find a workflow that works, make it repeatable. Turn it into a playbook so your whole team benefits.”

Slide 12 — Action Item

Visual: 2-column table (AI owns vs Human owns)

Speaker Notes:
“Here’s one action item to make it real. Run a quick audit this week. Write down your daily and weekly tasks. Circle the ones that repeat again and again — those are strong candidates for AI. Then mark the ones where judgment, creativity, or relationships matter most. Those stay with you and your team.”

Slide 13 — Three Rules Recap

Bullets:

AI owns repetitive work

Humans keep judgment

Playbooks scale your wins

Speaker Notes:
“And remember the three rules we built on: let AI handle the repetitive work, keep human judgment for creativity and relationships, and turn repeatable workflows into playbooks. You saw each of these today — Hub Agent showing where AI owns the repetitive, Site Designer leaving space for your judgment, and the Partner Program helping you scale with playbooks.”

Slide 14 — Call to Action

Headline: Handle Monday mornings without burning out
Bullets:

Use Hub Agent to cut hours to minutes

Use Site Designer Agent to deliver drafts faster

Join Partner Agency Program to grow with GoDaddy

Speaker Notes:
“That’s how you handle Monday morning with 400 sites, red alerts, and a new client — without burning out. Thank you.”
